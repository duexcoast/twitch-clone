Hey Bobby, 

I've spent the last couple of hours trying to debug this and can't figure out for the life of me what I'm doing wrong. Everything was working perfectly up until now. 

When I click the Create Stream button, I am navigated to path="/" , but the component runs into the Error I put above: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'userId'). 

I can then refresh the page, and the StreamCreate.js component renders perfectly, and the list of streams contains the stream I just created. I'm at a loss for why the component is unable to access my redux store when I navigate to it this way, but it works totally fine when I navigate normally. My only guess is that
